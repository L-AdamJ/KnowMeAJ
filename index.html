<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Adam Jaber. I am a senior that transferred to Lewis University a year ago. 
    I have a family of 5; My parents and 3 siblings. However, I only live with 
    3 of them as one of my sisters lives in Texas and my other sister has an apartment by the
    college they attend. My major is computer science with no minor.</p>

<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>To improve my programming skills</li>
    <li>Improve in teammwork skills</li>
    <li>Learn more about HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h3>
<p>My favorite hobby would probably be playing video games. Games that I tend to play are 
    strategy, platforming, and sometimes player vs player games. With that said, I am usually open to 
    playing any kind of game as long it is fun. I also enjoy spectating and talking about Basketball.</p>

<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
<p>My fun fact is that I hate fun facts. I do not try to find something that makes me unique
    or different from other people. Even if I did try to find something unique, it probably is not.
    There are around 7 billion people on this planet there is no way I'm the only one who can do X or thinks
    like Y.</p>

<h1>Greatest Innovations</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>The smartphone is one of the greatest innovations as 
        it allowed for phones to do more than just call and text others.

    <li>The Internet is a big deal; it changed how a lot of things work in 
        society. For instance, homework tends to be turned in through the Internet
        as opposed to in person. Plus, many classes can be attended online with or without zoom and
        there are some classes that rely on both online and in person classes. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-internet">

    <li>The invention of computers is big as many professions heavily rely on PC's. classes
        in the modern day are also reliant on the student having at least a laptop. I remember
        when math homework was given in class and in person, but now I have to access the homework and turn it in through
        my laptop instead <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-pc">
